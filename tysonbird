My name is Tyson Bird
I'm studying Journalism (Graphics)
In this class, I want to learn new tools to tell stories online by building websites and learning more about data journalism
I'm interested in learning programming for interactive media because I think it's the future of the field, especially in visual journalism, because print products are becoming more and more rare
