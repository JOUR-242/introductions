My name is Matt Roembke, I am a junior from New Palestine, Indiana
Im a Telecommunications Major with a Visual Presentation Certificate
I want to learn everything I can about HTML and CSS
I want to learn about codeing because it is a skill that employers are going to be looking at in a designer. Front and Back end design is essential in todays world.
Much like some of you, I have had the majority of my classes in this lab. It is like a second home.
