Hi I'm Hannah!
I'm a Journalism Graphics Major
I want gain a more proficient knowledge in HTML5 and CSS
I love to tell stories visually and I think that a solid knowledge of programming and coding can really help improve my skills.
I have a slightly shameful love of 1D and an infinite love of Harry Potter.
