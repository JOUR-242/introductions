Greetings all

My name is Robby General.
I am a Journalism & Telecommunications news concentration major with a minor in sports studies.
In this program I hope to gather a fundamental understanding of different coding languages to creat fun and interactive projeects that give me some tips to take back to my student organizations.
I'm interested in programming for interactive media because every journalist should be able to program. I want to set myself apart by learning coding and I hope to take some of these tools learned in this class to make my stories and website more interactive and add another dimension rather than just text.
Well I like to write about mainly anything, but if I had the choice I would prefer to talk about sports. I'm the sports editor at the Ball State Daily News and am also a sports anchord on Newslink Indiana. I'm a fraternity member and Excellence in Leadership ambassador on campus as well. I'd say I'm easy to talk to and can't wait to get to know all of you better!
