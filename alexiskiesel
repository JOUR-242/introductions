Who are you? Alexis Kiesel
What sequence are you in? Public Relations; Journalistic Visual Presentation
What do you want to learn in this class? I would like to learn about coding, interactivity and what creates the most user satisfaction in relation to interactivity.
Why are you interested in programming for interactive media? I believe it will help me be more proficient in the broad field of public relations and in the technological world in general.
Anything else you want the class to know? I am a little nervous (but a lot excited!) to learn about programming for interactivity, which is a completely new concept for me!
