Who are you?
  Tiffany Watt
What sequence are you in?
  Graphics
What do you want to learn in this class?
  Different programs (JQuery, Python, etc.)
Why are you interested in programming for interactive media?
  We all have worked with some form of interactivity from typing on a keyboard to using an app to get information and I think if I'm going
  to be using something or interacting with something I should probably understand the process behind it. 
Anything else you want the class to know?
  I've got nothing, so no.
