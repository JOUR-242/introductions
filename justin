My name is Justin Heck. I'm a junior from Greenfield, Indiana. 
I'm a journalism graphics major. 
I'm excited to learn more about css and html.
Being able to code effectively is something that is very useful in the area in which I'm hoping to have a career in.
Nothing else really comes to mind right away.
