I'm an advertising major with a certificate in journalistic visual presentation.
I am excited to learn about HTML and CSS
I know these skills are expected of any designer in an advertising agency today so I want to acquire them to be more marketable in the future job market.
Over the summer I had a bit of an existential crisis. I've always thought my favorite color was blue but then I realzied how cool red is. But don't fret, I am once again confident that blue is my favorite and, therefore, confident in myself.
